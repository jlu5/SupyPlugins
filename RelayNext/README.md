**RelayNext** is a next generation relayer system for Limnoria, designed with two-way relays in mind. It is intended as a replacement for the stock Relay plugin, and an alternative to the LinkRelay plugin.

RelayNext supports relaying between channels with different names, and stores its entries in a database instead of the configuration, preventing various forms of entry corruption.

## Usage

### Creating a new relay

Creating a relay is simple, simply run:

* `relaynext add Your-relay-name #channel1@networkOne #somewhere@networkTwo`

on your bot. **You must specify a name for the relay! (replacing `your-relay-name` with whatever)**

### Modifying relays

Once a relay is created, you can manipulate these entries further using the `set`, `add`, and `remove` commands.

* `relaynext add Your-relay-name #somewhere@overTheRainbow`
* `relaynext remove Your-relay-name #channel1@networkOne`

Relays are case-insensitive and require at least two channels to relay between. When the last two channels are removed, the relay is automatically deleted.

Note: The `set` command **replaces** the relay in question, while `add` **adds** channels to it. Both will create a new relay if the name you specify doesn't already exist.

### Listing defined relays

The `list` command will list all relays defined.

* `relaynext list`

### Removing/clearing relays

You can remove relays (or channels within them) using the `remove` command. There is also a `clear` command which clears all relays.

To remove channels from an existing relay:

* `relaynext remove Your-relay-name #channel1@networkone #blah@networktwo`

Or, to delete an entire relay:

* `relaynext remove Your-relay-name`

Relays require at least two channels to relay between. When the last two channels are removed, the relay is automatically deleted.

## Configuration

Most of the following options are also configurable per channel. For any channel-specific variables, settings on the target relay channel are used for NICK and QUIT messages, while settings on the source channel are applied for all others. This is because nick changes and quits are not bound to any channels.

### Relaying non-PRIVMSG events

RelayNext supports relaying the following non-PRIVMSG events: joins, kicks, mode changes, nick changes, parts, quits, and topic changes. Each of these can be turned on and off using configuration variables, and have the following defaults:

- `config plugins.RelayNext.events.relayjoins`: `True`
- `config plugins.RelayNext.events.relaykicks`: `True`
- `config plugins.RelayNext.events.relaymodes`: `True`
- `config plugins.RelayNext.events.relaynicks`: `True`
- `config plugins.RelayNext.events.relayparts`: `True`
- `config plugins.RelayNext.events.relayquits`: `True`
- `config plugins.RelayNext.events.relaytopics`: `False`

Note: Topic relaying will only show topic *changes* in a channel. **It does not yet sync topics between channels!**

### Ignoring users
RelayNext uses Supybot's built in ignore system. However, you can set which messages you want to ignore (from ignored users) using `config plugins.RelayNext.events.userignored`. This is NOT a list of users to ignore, which is defined with Limnoria's global ignore system (eg. with the command `admin ignore add *!*@spammer.example`).

This key takes a space separated list, and defaults to ignoring `PRIVMSG` and `MODE`. **If you want to disable the ignore feature entirely, simply set this value blank: `config plugins.RelayNext.events.userignored ""`**

### Highlight prevention
One annoying aspect of relays is that when someone is on multiple relayed channels with the same nick, they will be spammed with highlights whenever they speak. RelayNext can mitigate this behavior by inserting an invisible space in the middle of the nick.

You can turn this prefixing on via:
* `config plugins.RelayNext.noHighlight True`

### Flood prevention
Flood prevention in RelayNext can be enabled with the following configuration option:
* `config plugins.RelayNext.antiflood.enable True`

When flood prevention is triggered, a warning message is displayed and all further messages of the matched type will be ignored for a certain amount of seconds. For example, in the event of a netsplit, QUIT and JOIN messages will be blocked to prevent the bot from flooding itself off, allowing conversations to be relayed mostly unaffected.

The following options allow you to fine tune RelayNext's flood prevention:

* `plugins.RelayNext.antiflood.maximum`: configure the maximum amount of messages (PRIVMSGs) allowed in *X* seconds before flood prevention is triggered.
* `plugins.RelayNext.antiflood.maximum.nonPrivmsgs`: configure the maximum amount of each non-PRIVMSG events (joins, quits, etc.) allowed in *X* seconds before flood prevention is triggered.
* `plugins.RelayNext.antiflood.seconds`: configure the *X* amount of seconds mentioned above.
* `plugins.RelayNext.antiflood.timeout`: determines the amount of seconds the bot will wait before flood prevention expires (messages are relayed as normal again).

### Miscellaneous formatting options

- You can enable/disable colors via the configuration variable `plugins.RelayNext.color`
- Hostmask display can be configured via `plugins.RelayNext.hostmasks`. It defaults to True to make impersonating nicks more difficult, but you can turn this off if you wish.
- Prefix display (`@`, `%`, or `+` in front of nicks) can be toggled via `plugins.RelayNext.showPrefixes`.
